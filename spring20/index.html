    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This course introduces students to the next step in operating system design
      (after CS 241 or equivalent).
      Students will understand the main operating system functions in class and
      analyze their implementation through a series of machine problems
      that require modifications to operating system code.
      Students will also be exposed to the concepts of virtual machines
      and issues of distribution such distributed files systems
      and map-reduce operators for distributed computation.
      The course will conclude with a series of advanced topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding the material or concerns about whether your background is suitable for the course.

    <h2>Textbooks</h2>

    <p> Course Text:
      <ul>
          <li>
            Operating Systems: Principles & Practice (2nd Edition), Thomas Anderson, Michael Dahlin, 2014
          </li>
      </ul>

    </p>
      Much of the course will be following the above textbook, and it is recommend that you purchase
      a copy of this book (either edition). You will be responsible for the chapters of the textbook
      that are discussed in class. You do not strictly need the book, however;
      any exercises you are asked to complete in the text will be made available to you on Compass2G.
      Therefore, any of the other major operating system textbooks would be a suitable replacement if you have one around.
    </p>

  <p>Alternative Texts:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Operating System Concepts (9th edition), Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin and Greg Gagne, 2012
      </li>
      <li>
          Modern Operating Systems (4rd Edition), Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Prentice Hall, 2014
      </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Optional Reading:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Virtual Machines, James E. Smith and Ravi Nair, Elsevier / Morgan Kaufmann, 2005
      </li>
      <li>
          Linux Kernel Development (3rd Edition), Robert Love, 2010
      </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      You may find the Linux Kernel Development book to be helpful when completing yours MPs.
  </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
      The course will involve 5 machine problems, several homeworks, a midterm, and a final.
      Unless otherwise noted by the instructor, all work in this course is to be completed independently.
      If you are ever uncertain of how to complete an assignment,
       you can go to office hours or engage in high-level discussions
       about the problem with your classmates on the Piazza boards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grades will be assigned as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <i>Machine Problems:</i> Five MPs will collectively account for 30% of the grade, divided into 2%, 7%, 7%, 7%, and 7%. <b>All MPs should be solved individually.</b> <b>No late submissions are allowed.</b></li>
        <li> <i>Homework:</i> Homeworks account for 10% of the grade. Homeworks will be assigned sparingly. They will consist of multiple choice or short answer questions assigned on Compass2G. The first homework will test your prerequisite knowledge for the course. Another homework will be a practice exercise set for the final exam.</li>
        <li> <i>Midterm:</i> The midterm will be worth 25% of your grade, date/time TBD.</li>
        <li> <i>Final:</i> A final exam will be worth 25% of your grade, date/time TBD.</li>
        <li> <i>Participation:</i> Accounts for 10%. Includes quizzes and class discussion (either in person or online).</li>
        <li> <i>4 Credit Section Only:</i> If you are registered for the four credit version of this course, you will be required to complete and summarize weekly literature readings that are relevant to the subject matter being discussed in class. Satisfactory completion of these readings will be necessary to receive full credit in homework and participation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Expectations</h2>

    <p>
      The expectations for the course are that students will attend every class, do any readings assigned for class, and actively and constructively participate in class discussions. Class participation will be a measure of contributing to the discourse both in class, through discussion and questions, and outside of class through contributing and responding to the Piazza forum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of respect for your classmates, I ask that you turn off all laptops, tablets, and phone screens for the duration of each class!
    </p>

    <p>
      More information about course requirements will be made available leading up to the start of classes
    </p>
